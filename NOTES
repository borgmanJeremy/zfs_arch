he repository for Arch Linux based distribution can be found at https://pkg.surfacelinux.com/arch/.

This repository provides only binary kernel packages as well as the secure boot key. The utilities and tools (i.e. surface-dtx-daemon, surface-control, and libwacom-surface) can be found in the Arch user repository (AUR). Pre-compiled packages of the surface control utility and the DTX daemon are available under the -bin suffix (i.e. surface-control-bin).

Before adding this repository, you should first add the key used to sign the packages in it. You can do this by running the following commands:

wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/master/pkg/keys/surface.asc \
    | sudo pacman-key --add -

It is recommended that you now fingerprint it by running

sudo pacman-key --finger 56C464BAAC421453

and in a final step, you have to locally sign the key to trust it via

sudo pacman-key --lsign-key 56C464BAAC421453

More infos on this process can be found at https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman/Package_signing#Adding_unofficial_keys. You can now add the repository by editing /etc/pacman.conf and adding

[linux-surface]
Server = https://pkg.surfacelinux.com/arch/




Install the required packages.

    For Arch:

    sudo pacman -S linux-surface-headers linux-surface surface-ipts-firmware
